        <h1>2015</h1>
        <p>It all started with me going to freerun classes in my village, here i could practice tricks and skills that i wanted to. For me it was an amazing alternetive to football or basketball.<br><br>

            To show my progress i will introduce you to my youtube channel that I made with some friends.
            
            (This was in 2015, so donâ€™t pay to much attention to the production quality)

                <div>
                <p>Here you can see one of the first videos we made, this was back in 2015 when I started with freerunning outside of the classes. <br><br>

                This was a challenge because it was the start of freerunning without soft pads to land, without these soft pads the chance of breaking something increases heavily. <br><br>
                
                But the danger added to the fun we had, you get a lot more fanatic when there is something at stake. <br><br></p>

        <div class="textcont">
            <p>One of the more fun things I did was going to trampoline parks, at these parks you virtually have no risks so you can go full out on doing your tricks or trying new stuff out. <br><br>

                Like usual we filmed our stuff and tried to make it entertaining (7.5k views seems entertaining)</p>
